## 1. Introduction
- Global context of water scarcity in agriculture and critical need for efficient irrigation
- Evolution from traditional irrigation scheduling to data-driven approaches
- Challenges in current practices: labor-intensive data collection, delayed decision-making, integration issues
- Overview of scheduling methods evaluated:
  - CWSI-only scheduling
  - SWSI-only scheduling
  - Combined weighted indices (60% SWSI, 40% CWSI)
  - ET-based scheduling (baseline)
- Novel aspects of combining plant and soil water stress indicators
- Brief reference to Crop2Cloud platform implementation
- Research objectives:
  - Primary: Evaluate efficacy of combining plant and soil water stress indices
  - Secondary: Compare performance metrics, analyze index relationships, assess integration benefits
