Here is the text with the formulas wrapped for inline equations where necessary:

**1. Application Efficiency (Ea):**

* **Formula:** $Ea = 100\% \times \frac{dn}{da}$

* **Expanded Context:**  "Irrigation systems are never 100% efficient. The major ways water can be 'lost' from an irrigated field are...evaporation..., drift..., runoff..., deep percolation due to nonuniform infiltration, and…deep percolation due to excessive application. ...The manager must minimize losses where possible…[and] should know how much water might typically be lost so that applications can be adjusted to meet plant needs. Application efficiency (Ea) is usually defined as the fraction of the applied water that is stored in the root zone and is available for crop water use.” The text emphasizes that Ea is influenced by system characteristics, management, soil and crop conditions, and weather, resulting in a wide range of possible values.

**2. Distribution Uniformity (DU):**

* **Formula:** $DU = \frac{d_{LQ}}{d}$

* **Expanded Context:** “Irrigation systems are not capable of applying exactly the same depth of water to every location in the field.  The distribution of applied water varies because of factors such as wind drift, improper pipeline pressure, poor design, and inappropriate system management...nonuniform applications lead to nonuniform depths of infiltration and ultimately to varying amounts of soil water in the root zone. This nonuniformity adversely affects plant performance so information about the uniformity of application is needed to manage irrigation systems effectively."  DU provides a simple way to quantify this nonuniformity, using the lowest quarter of observed depths as a representative measure.

**3. Christiansen Uniformity Coefficient (CU):**

* **Formula:** $CU = 100\% \times \left(1 - \frac{\sum|d_i - d|}{nd}\right)$  _or_   $CU = 100\% \times (1 – \frac{\text{average deviation}}{\text{mean depth infiltrated}})$

* **Expanded Context:** CU is “another index to indicate application uniformity."  The text specifically mentions its use in relation to *catch can data* collected under sprinkler systems. Critically, the book notes: "Typically, water depths in the equation are amounts *caught in the cans, not infiltrated water*. Since the distribution of *infiltration* is really what is of interest, the depth of water caught in the can used…will indicate infiltrated water *only if no surface runoff occurs*.”

**4. Heermann and Hein Coefficient of Uniformity (CUH):**

* **Formula:** $CUH = 100\% \times \left(1 - \frac{\sum|d_i - d_z^*|S_i}{\sum d_z^* S_i}\right)$

* **Expanded Context:** This is a specialized coefficient "ordinarily used for pivots" because in circular systems "a container located far from the pivot point represents more area than one close to the pivot point.” The weighting accounts for this varying area representation to better reflect field-wide uniformity.

**5. Application Efficiency of the Low Quarter (ELQ):**

* **Formula:** $ELQ = 100\% \times \frac{d_e}{d_a}$

* **Expanded Context:**  ELQ links efficiency and uniformity by incorporating "all water 'losses' during application…evaporation and drift, runoff, deep percolation due to nonuniform infiltration, and deep percolation due to excessive application." The effective depth (de) represents the portion of applied water that is both stored in the root zone *and* avoids being lost to deep percolation due to *either* nonuniformity *or* over-application, based on managing to the average low quarter depth ($d_{LQ}$).

**6. Conveyance Efficiency (Ec):**

* **Formula:** $Ec = 100\% \times \frac{d_a}{d_s}$

* **Expanded Context:**  Focuses on losses *before* water reaches the irrigation system. Water can be lost "due to seepage from the canal or other conduit, by evaporation from exposed water surfaces, and by evapotranspiration from phreatophytes along the conveyance system. Water can also be lost because of operational problems...[such as when] an irrigator originally requested water delivery but later decided not to take the full supply…[or] excess flow would be required to supply the requested amount" due to multiple users on a shared system.

1. Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE):

$
IWUE = \frac{Y}{I}
$

Where:
- $Y$ = Yield (kg/ha)
- $I$ = Irrigation applied (mm)

2. Crop Water Use Efficiency (CWUE):

$
CWUE = \frac{Y}{ET_o}
$

Where:
- $Y$ = Yield (kg/ha)
- $ET_o$ = Total evapotranspiration (mm)

For unit clarity:

$
IWUE \ \text{units} = \frac{kg \cdot ha^{-1}}{mm} = kg \cdot ha^{-1} \cdot mm^{-1}
$

$
CWUE \ \text{units} = \frac{kg \cdot ha^{-1}}{mm} = kg \cdot ha^{-1} \cdot mm^{-1}
$

- IWUE focuses on artificially applied water (irrigation)
- CWUE considers total water consumption through evapotranspiration
